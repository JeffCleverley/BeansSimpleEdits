# Beans Simple Edits

Plugin to add the ability to make simple edits to Beans theme post meta areas and the footer without touching any code.

Can make simple edits to 5 areas:

1. Post Meta above content area
2. Post Meta below Content area
3. Left Footer content area
4. Right Footer content area
5. Central Footer Area*

Each content area has an textarea input in the admin where you can add custom content.  

If you add custom content then the default content is not shown.  

Each Content Area can be disabled and removed.

*Central content area is a new area, if enabled it will replace the left and right split content areas from the default footer.

Works well with Beans Simple Shortcodes: https://github.com/JeffCleverley/BeansSimpleShortCodes
